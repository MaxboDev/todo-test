# TODO List App

This is the starter for a ToDo list app built with Rect and TypeScript. We'll build upon this as part of the exercise.

## Requirements
1. Add items to a todo list when the "Add" button is clicked.
2. Make it possible to mark items in the todo list as done. When marked as done, they should move into a new done list in the UI.
3. Make it possible to delete items from the list.
4. Store the items in local storage and load them from there when the app loads.
5. Make it possible to create new columns.
6. Make it possible to rename columns.
